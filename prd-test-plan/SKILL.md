# PRD Test Plan

Create comprehensive test plans covering unit tests, UI automation, manual tests, and release regression.

## Language

- Accept questions in both Chinese and English
- Always respond in Chinese
- Generate all documents in Chinese

## Trigger Conditions

- User has completed system design
- User asks for test plan or test cases
- User needs QA strategy or testing coverage

## Prerequisites

- Requirements document: `docs/prd/01-requirements.md`
- System design document: `docs/prd/02-system-design.md`
- If not exists, suggest running previous phases first

## Test Strategy Overview

| Test Type | Coverage Scope | Coverage Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Unit Test | Core business logic | Line coverage >= 80%, Branch coverage >= 80% |
| UI Automation | Core user scenarios | All P0 scenarios |
| Manual Test | All scenarios | All acceptance criteria |

## Workflow

1. **Read documents**: Load requirements and system design
2. **Identify test scope**: Map acceptance criteria to test types
3. **Design unit tests**: Cover core business logic
4. **Design UI automation**: Cover P0 user scenarios
5. **Design manual tests**: Cover all remaining scenarios
6. **Create regression plan**: Define pre-release checklist
7. **Confirm with user**: Get approval

## Output

**Files** in `docs/prd/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `03-test-plan.md` | Test strategy overview and coverage matrix |
| `03-test-unit.md` | Unit test cases and mock strategy |
| `03-test-e2e.md` | UI automation test cases |
| `03-test-manual.md` | Manual test cases |
| `03-test-regression.md` | Pre-release regression checklist |

For detailed templates, see:
- [templates/unit-test-template.md](templates/unit-test-template.md)
- [templates/e2e-test-template.md](templates/e2e-test-template.md)
- [templates/manual-test-template.md](templates/manual-test-template.md)
- [templates/regression-template.md](templates/regression-template.md)

## Constraints

- [ ] **Unit tests must cover core business logic with >= 80% line and branch coverage**
- [ ] **UI automation must cover all P0 scenarios**
- [ ] Manual test cases must cover all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each core feature needs at least 1 positive test case
- [ ] Each user input needs at least 1 negative test case
- [ ] Must provide acceptance criteria coverage matrix
- [ ] Priority labels: P0 (blocker), P1 (major), P2 (minor)
- [ ] Test steps must be executable, not vague
- [ ] Unit tests must specify mock strategy
- [ ] **Must include pre-release regression checklist**
- [ ] **Must define rollback conditions and post-release verification**

## Next Step

After user confirms test plan, suggest running `/prd-dev-tasks` for development task breakdown.
